# Bayesian Data Analysis - Predicting heart disease

In this project we create a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model and use them to predict if a hospitalised patient has a heart disease or not. Detailed explanations about the models and project are in project-report.pdf. The project is part of the Aalto University Bayesian Data Analysis 2020 course.

hierarchical_model.stan and non_hierarchical_model.stan contain the used Stan models.

run.R contains the R code used in the project.

The data set used is from https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
